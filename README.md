# Engineering-Talent-Review-App
Purpose:
  An app with the purpose of efficiently promoting the most qualified employee. 
  This app consists of a form containing an employee's personal information, educational history, professional history, and other personal  information. This form is meant to be filled out by a manager or peer but NOT the employee being nominated.
  This app also has a recommender dashboard where peers or managers who have worked with the employee can write a recommendation for that specific employee. 
  All of this information is stored and provided to the Talent Review Committee Dashboard where the ones deciding on the best candidate are provided all the submitted information.
